# Metroid Prime Frigate Skipper  

Skips the Space Pirate Frigate for Metroid Prime  

------
## Usage  

### Windows  
Drag and drop the dol file onto frigate-skipper.exe or run it from the cmd with  
`frigate-skipper.exe path\to\dol\file.dol`  

### POSIX
`frigate-skipper path/to/dol/file.dol`

This can easily be done with a hex editor.  I made this as a way to learn C and binary file edits.
